# MARS — MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator

**MARS** is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language, commonly used in university-level courses such as *Computer Organization and Design* by Patterson & Hennessy.

The official **MARS v4.5** executable JAR file is available under the **Releases** section of this repository.

The MARS website has been relocated to:  
🔗 **https://dpetersanderson.github.io/**  
All documentation and downloads are available there. Some display issues are still being refined, and contributions or suggestions are welcome—particularly from those experienced with GitHub Pages.

MARS was originally developed by **Pete Sanderson** and **Ken Vollmar**, professors at Otterbein University and Missouri State University, respectively. Though both are now retired, MARS remains a stable and widely used legacy application throughout universities worldwide (as of 2024).  
The last official release was **MARS 4.5 (August 2014)**.

Until October 2024, the MARS website and hosted downloads were maintained by Missouri State University. They have since been migrated to this repository.

# MARS 4.6 — GitHub-Integrated Version

This enhanced version of MARS has been modified by **Duc Le**, a student at **San Diego State University (SDSU)**, to provide built-in GitHub integration.  
The goal is to streamline file management for students—allowing upload and download of assembly files directly between MARS and GitHub.

This modification was developed for **CS 240** under Professor **Dominic**, whose teaching made the project both enjoyable and creatively inspiring.

## 2. Uploading Files
To upload a file to GitHub:

1. Open the **Upload** option under the GitHub tab.  
2. Select the file on your local machine.  
3. Choose an existing repository or create a new one through the interface.  
4. Enter a branch name (e.g., `main`) and a commit message.  
5. Click **Submit**.  

You can verify the upload by checking your repository on GitHub.

# CS 240 Project Theme — Demon Slayer Assembly Language

For CS 240, students are required to design a *custom assembly language*.  
My project is themed around the anime **Demon Slayer**, featuring:

- 30 unique "technique" instructions  
- Styles including **Water**, **Sun**, **Thunder**, **Beast**, and **Nezuko**  
- Custom formats, instruction sets, and opcode mappings  

An example test implementation is included in this repository.  
The final project will feature **10 fully implemented techniques** as part of a small game.

# Acknowledgments

Thank you to **Professor Dominic** for creating such an engaging environment that encouraged creativity and exploration.  
I hope this modified version of MARS helps future students with their assignments and projects.

**Best of luck to everyone,**  
**Duc Le**
